# User Scheduling in 5G

This project focuses on solving an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem using greedy, dynamic programming, and branch and bound methods in the context of user scheduling in 5G networks.

## Overview

User scheduling is a crucial aspect of 5G networks to efficiently allocate network resources and optimize system performance. This project explores different algorithms to solve the user scheduling problem.

## Methods Implemented

1. Greedy Algorithm
2. Dynamic Programming
3. Branch and Bound
4. Online approach

Each method is implemented and evaluated in terms of its effectiveness and efficiency in solving the user scheduling problem.
